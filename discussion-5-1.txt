Segment: Generative A.I. technologies can write poetry and computer programs or create images of teddy bears and videos of cartoon characters that look like something from a Hollywood movie.
Now, new A.I. technology is generating blueprints for microscopic biological mechanisms that can edit your DNA, pointing to a future when scientists can battle illness and diseases with even greater precision and speed than they can today.

Summary: A Berkeley CA startup called Profluent is using an AI technology that is based on the same methods as ChatGPT to generate new gene editors, called OpenCRISPR-1. These gene editors can alter genes that cause hereditary conditions like sickle cell anemia and blindness.

/\b[A-Z][a-zA-Z.]*\b/g matches capitalized words. \b is a word boundary. [] matches the range inside. * matches 0 or more.
